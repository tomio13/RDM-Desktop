# experiment recording form for dynamic light scattering experiments

doc: |
  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) also called photon correlation spectroscopy is
  a light scattering 
  Single or a series of measurements run as a temperature or time series.
  Please attach every recorded file in the series.
