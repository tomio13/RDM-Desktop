# RDM-desktop
Research data management is a very actual topic.
There are millions of solutions out there, aiming to collect
metadata and data from users into databases using various web
interfaces.

# do something locally
This project aims to add a solution how one can easily manage
experiments on a local computer using the file system and structured
storage.
[You can read more about this in the motivation ...](./docs/Motivation.md).

# Python and C
The original aim was to write this code in C, but python is a bit easier
to get fast solutions, so first the focus was shifted to get a relatively
complete functionality together.

# Current state
The basic features are in place by now, the program allowing for:
- making project folders
- sample folders
- adding experiments

For more information, please [read the documentation](./docs/Readme.md).

The program is still in beta phase, currently working on the upload feature
first to an ElabFTW server.
