# python implementation
This is a python implementation and a workspace to develop the concepts in the RDM-desktop project. These ideas then to be transfered to C for improved performance and smaller program size. However, it is also critical here to keep things as simple as possible.

# Tkinter: Tcl/Tk
I employ Tkinter because this is typically installed in all basic python installs.
The resulted GUI is still in the few MB size (currently about 6 MB)

# Functionalities
- a project folder generator
- a widget that lists projects, samples and experiments
- configuration loader / generator / saver
- widget to turn templates to forms, save experiments --> under construction
