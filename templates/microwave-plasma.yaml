# Experiment recording for microwave plasma activation
#
doc: | 
  Microwave plasma is often used to clean, activate or modify solid
  surfaces. The chemical reaction always have an oxidative nature,
  but the exact process also depends on the gas used.
  
  There are various devices on the marked, which control the gas flow
  and / or pressure, microwave power and processing time.
  Often the actual plasma activity is shorter than the processing time
  set, because at low power/pressure for older systems, ignition may
  be delayed (see TEPLA 100 or 100E).
