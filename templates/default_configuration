# a default template to be used for the RDM-desktop
#
# The program loads this file if it founds it, if not,
# the falls back to some hard coded values.
# For some variables, like the default path, overriding
# the automatic detection means to be sure the user
# has the right to write the specified folder!
#

# HomeDir: this is the base path
# to where we place the projects, etc.
# By default this value is not set,
# the system tries some default, like
# the home folder of the user on non-windows systems,
# or drive D:\ or C:\%HOMEDIR%/Documents on Windows.
#
# If you force this, it may not be interoperable between
# systems. Still, it can be a good idea in some cases.
#
# This is the only path variable with absolute path. All
# others MUST BE SET to relative paths!
# homeDir: 'D:\'

# removing this or setting to false,
# the configuration would not be saved for the user
# meaning this file here and the default config would
# be used every time.
# Useful when running with configuration and
# data being on an USB drive for example.
save config: true

# To save the merged record with its template
# In that case the same setting will be also set into the
# record, to make sure the system recognizes it as a full
# record, and does not search for templates.
# The resulted files will be more interchangeable with other
# systems.
# full record: true

# path of the project dir relative to the homeDir:
projectDir: Projects
projectsTitle: Projects
# what names readme files should have:
readme: readme.md

# chemicals is for future use, a relative path within
# the project dir
chemicals: Chemicals
# default template file names
# Relative path for equipment data (for future use)
equipment: Equipment

defaultTemplate:
- readmeProject
- readmeSample
- defaultForm
# use the form editor to edit experiment records:
# (make sure the templates are all available!)
use form: true
# Which is the default text editor?
# Uses nano for non-Win systems or Notepad for Windows
# editor: scite

# Again, for most cases the default automatic setting
# works the best: xdg-open / Explorer for Win.
# filemanager: xdg-open

# Local folders  to ignore in Projects dir
ignore:
- References


# This folder tree is to define the structure within the main
# folder
# We have projects with their name in projectDir
# At next level, all samples are listed under 'projectDir'/Data
# then all experiments are directly under the sample folder name
# if you change this, you may have to follow up in the templates,
# where %1, %2, ... are used to extract the current sample or project
# name...
searchFolders:
- ''
- Data
- ''
# with what name are we referring to the levels above?
# As it was just mentioned, default are: project / sample / experiment
searchNames:
- project
- sample
- experiment
# by what simple pattern we collect the relavant information in the
# file browser window? For the dirs, we use no pattern (list everything
# except the ignore list, for files we use files ending as yaml.
searchPattern:

searchTargets:
- dir

# It is possible to upload experiments to servers
# First ElabFTW is supported, but other uploaders can also
# be provided.
# For that we need: a sever URL, an API key or token,
server:
  server: ''
  token: ''

# Templates are in the templateDir, which has a relative path
# from the place of the executed file (RDM_project.py or an exe file)
# Here it is possible to make it custom for a group or institute
# (With the exception of this very file, which has to be found that
# these values can take effect)
templateDir: ../templates

# default templates can be used to create folder trees...
# we definitely use one to make a folder tree for projects
templates:
- folderlist
- ''
- ''
# user ID: it is best to leave this automatic, something the users should perhaps
# set in their local copy. Making the same user for everyone (setting it here)
# will often cause problems.
# userID: AnonymousCoward
#
# The version of this configuration. If it is newer than what the users have,
# then the local configuration gets automatically updated.
# The default is set by the software in get_default_config
# One may increment it in the next empty digit to make changes in full record,
# or similar parts propagating through
# version: 0.36
